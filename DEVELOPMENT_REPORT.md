## 🚨 Current Issue: RLS Policy Setup Required

### The Problem
The document upload feature is failing with this error:
```
ERROR: Upload error: {"error": "Unauthorized", "message": "new row violates row-level security policy", "statusCode": "403"}
```

### The Solution
The Supabase database needs proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies. I've created a complete setup guide in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` that includes:

1. **Complete Database Schema**: All tables with proper relationships
2. **RLS Policies**: Secure access policies for all tables
3. **Storage Policies**: Document upload/download permissions
4. **RPC Functions**: Helper functions for complex queries

### Setup Instructions
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the schema creation commands from `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
4. Run the RLS policy commands
5. Verify all tables and policies are created
